TreeComponent Framework
=======================

TreeComponent is an experimental web framework for building reactive web apps using Tree Notation.

## Basic design

TreeComponent allows you to define your reactive single page web app as a very high level Tree Language. TreeComponent integrates Hakon for CSS, Stump for HTML, and in the future a Tree Language for Javascript, so your app has a universal syntax from top to bottom.

## Willow

Willow abstracts the browser from TreeComponent.
